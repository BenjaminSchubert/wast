Workflow AsSiTant
=================

**Flexible developer workflow automation CLI in Python**

wast takes inspiration from `tox <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/>`_ and
`nox <https://github.com/wntrblm/nox>`_ and delivers a middle ground, the
builtin isolation of tox, together with the scriptability of nox, mixed with
dependency management and provided common use cases.

⚠️ This project is currently in early development. Contributions and issues are
very welcome but compatibility may be broken at any point.

.. TODO: add comparison with tox/nox
.. TODO: add overview and installation
